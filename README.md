Resolvent analysis over rigid wall and compliant wall in MATLAB

'IO gain' folder is for computing singular values
'singularvalue_up.m' is the function to compute singular values using unstructured/structured input-output analysis, over rigid/compliant wall
'UF_up.m' is the function to compute the velocity, pressure, and force modes

'convection' folder is for computing convective velocity
'PSD.m' is the function to compute the power spectral density

all files start with 'main_...' are for parallel computing
all files start with 'plot_...' are for drawing figures
